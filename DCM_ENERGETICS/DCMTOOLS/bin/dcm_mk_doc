# DCM tools for code management.
## Forewords
  As part of the DCM, a series of small bash scripts were written in order to help the code management
and to facilitate the user experience with DCM. This manual is automatically edited from the \`USAGE\` 
messages that any dcm tool provides when using \`-h\` option. It is the results of \`dcm_mk_doc\` tool. 
In order to make this manual more readable, an intent of classification by categories is done.

 All scripts belonging to DCM tools have a name starting with \`dcm_\` which makes then easy to find when 
the automatic completion is used. They are located in the \`$HOMEDCM/bin\` directory.
