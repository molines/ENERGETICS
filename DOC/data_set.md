# DATA SET produced during the coupled run ENERGETICS

## Context
The ENERGETICS project, aimed at producing an ocean-atmosphere  coupled simulation at very high resolution ( 1/36 for the ocean and 1/12 for the atmosphere).
The coupled system turned to be unstable after a little more than 3 years, despite all the efforts made to make it stable.

Therefore, three different runs were performed, named after Sebastien nomenclature now00, now01 and now02
  * now00 was run for 3 years (2004-2006), and after 3 years, we found many flaws in this simulation:
   * much too warm Caribbean Sea
   * imprint of the sea-ice coverage even when no ice present 
   * The sea-ice problem was found to be a bug in the coupling interface between the ice and the atmosphere. Once corrected we launch now01
  * now01 was run for 16 months, starting always Jan. 2004. It was stopped because the warm drift in the tropics was still there, not suprisingly.
   * After this warm drift was detected, changes on the atmospheric boundary layer scheme were introduced (_To be described at minimum_), hence leading to now02 
  * now02 was then run  for a little bit more than 3 years (38 months), always starting Jan. 2004. The model suffered numerical instability and exploded by mid March, 2007.
   * Many tests were performed by Sebastien in order to control the instability (_description of tests_), but none results in stabilizing the model.

## Data set archived for now00 simulation
This data set is reduced and probably useless as a major bug was impacting the sea-ice coupling
