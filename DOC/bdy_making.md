# BDY making-of document

  * 4 open boundaries : South, North, Hudson, Baltic.
  * For efficiency, Northern boundary might be divided into 2 parts (West : Baffin bay, East: Gin seas).
  * For generic BDY, we will use `bdy_coordinates` descriptions of the boundaries.
  * We plan to use a rimwidth of 10
  * We plan to take revised version of BDY which allows for higher order schemes at the boundaries. Hence a rim-0 must be defined:
    * The OpenBoundary must have 2 ocean points behind the velocity line.
  * We plan to use GLORYS12 daily output

## Getting the GLORYS12 data.

### Data extaction
  According to the evolution of the services at Mercator, GLORYS12v1 data on the native grid are available on the 
[Mercator opendap server](http://tds.mercator-ocean.fr/thredds/catalog.html). The user must do the extraction by itself ( :( ).
 
  A python script example has been provided: [recup_barnier.py](../TOOLS/recup_barnier.py). This script used `xarray` module. Some typos were corrected (*i.e.* `decode_cf` instead of `cf_decode`) and a more generic version was created [get_glorys12.py](../TOOLS/get_glorys12.py)
